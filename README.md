# Learn Something New

A collection of coding examples and projects to help you learn something new.

## [Functional Programming](https://github.com/learn-something-new/functional-programming)

In this suite of documents we discuss functional programming: What it looks like, how it works, and what it's good for. We try to do this from a practical-but-fun perspective, showing examples of functional programming in conventional languages, and (most importantly) how functional programming can complement object-oriented programming.

## [Go Data Structures](https://github.com/learn-something-new/go-data-structures)
## [Go Slices](https://github.com/learn-something-new/go-slices)

In Go, slices are the most common way of dealing with sequences of data. Slices are an abstraction of the array type in Go. In this topic I provide a basic example of slices and how you can start using them.
