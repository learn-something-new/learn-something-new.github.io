We try to do this from a practical-but-fun perspective, showing examples of functional programming in conventional languages, and (most importantly) how functional programming can complement object-oriented programming.\r\n\r\n## [Go Data Structures](https://github.com/learn-something-new/go-data-structures)\r\n\r\nA collection of Go code for me to re-learn data structures including:\r\n\r\n+ Stacks - Fixed size structure with push and pop methods, following the FILO rule (first in, last out)\r\n+ Queues - Fixed size structure with add and del methods, following the FIFO rule (first in, first out)\r\n+ Linked Lists - Non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list. Their is no first or last out rule that applies to this list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.\r\n+ Doubly Linked Lists - Non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list as well the previous. Their is no first or last out rule that applies to this list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.\r\n\r\n## [Go Slices](https://github.com/learn-something-new/go-slices)\r\n\r\nIn Go, slices are the most common way of dealing with sequences of data. Slices are an abstraction of the array type in Go. In this topic I provide a basic example of slices and how you can start using them.\r\n\r\n## [C++ Data Structures](https://github.com/learn-something-new/data-structures)\r\n\r\nA collection of C++ code for me to re-learn data structures including:\r\n\r\n+ Stacks - Fixed size structure with push and pop methods, following the FIFO rule (first in, last out)\r\n+ Queues - Fixed size structure with add and del methods, following the FILO rule (first in, first out)\r\n+ Linked Lists - Non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list. Their is no first or last out rule that applies to this list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.\r\n+ Stacked Linked Lists - Non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with push and pop methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list. This structure follows the FILO rule (first in, last out).\r\n+ Doubly Linked Lists - Non-fixed (only restricted by available memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list as well the previous. Their is no first or last out rule that applies to this list as it allows the removal of any item in any order.  + Queued Linked List - Non-fixed (only restricted by avaliable memory) data structure with add and del methods. Each item or 'node' in the list contains a pointer to the next item in the list. This structure follows the FIFO rule (first in, first out).\r\n\r\n## Attributes\r\nIcon made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com \"Freepik\") from [www.flaticon.com](http://www.flaticon.com \"Flaticon\") is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ \"Creative Commons BY 3.0\")\r\n\r\n##License\r\nThis tool is protected by the [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\r\n\r\nCopyright [Jeffrey Hann](http://jeffreyhann.ca/) 2015\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
